=== Storybook

Our design system is documented using Storybook.
To access this documentation, please visit https://design.foxdeck.de.

Storybook is a powerful open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation.
It serves as a playground to build user interface components independently and interactively, allowing you to create components without needing to worry about application-specific dependencies.

Storybook supports a range of view libraries including React, Vue, Angular, and many others.
It provides a sandbox to test different states of your UI components and develop them outside of your application, which can also lead to better reusability of components.

In addition, Storybook allows you to create and showcase a component library, document the usage of each component, hence improving collaboration among team members.
It serves as a single point of reference for developers, UX/UI designers, testers and product owners.
