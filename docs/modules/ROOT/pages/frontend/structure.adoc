= Structure

The structure of the Frontend is based on the [modularised architecture](https://www.maxpou.fr/blog/vue-js-module-architecture/) which is also known from Applications build with Angular.

== What is a module?

In a Vue.js application, a module refers to a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates a specific functionality or feature.
Modules in Vue.js help organize code by breaking down the application into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to maintain and scale.

Typically, a Vue.js module consists of:

1. **Components:** These are reusable Vue.js components that encapsulate a specific piece of UI functionality.
Components can include template markup, JavaScript logic, and styles.
2. **State Management:** Modules often include state management solutions such as Vuex, which helps manage the application's state in a centralized store.
This allows components to access and modify data without directly communicating with each other.
3. **Routing:** For applications with multiple views or pages, modules may include routing functionality using Vue Router.
This enables navigation between different components or pages within the application.
4. **Services and Utilities:** Modules may also include various services or utility functions that provide common functionality across the application, such as API communication, validation, or data manipulation.

Overall, modules in Vue.js promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability by organizing code into smaller, cohesive units, which can be independently developed, tested, and updated.
It's important, that a module does not contain code from other modules and only shares the state via the core.

== Core

In the context of a Vue.js application, a "core" typically refers to the fundamental or essential functionality that forms the foundation of the application.
The "core" encompasses the central features, libraries, and infrastructure that are necessary for the application to function properly.

The "core" of a Vue.js application may include:

1. **Core Components:** These are basic building blocks provided by Vue.js, such as <template>, <script>, and <style>, which are used to define the structure, behavior, and styling of components.
2. **Global Configuration and Plugins:** The core often includes global configuration settings and plugins that extend Vue.js's capabilities, such as Vue Router for routing and Vuex for state management.
3. **Utilities and Helpers:** Core functionalities may also include various utility functions and helpers provided by Vue.js or third-party libraries, which assist in common tasks such as data manipulation, event handling, and debugging.

Overall, the "core" of a Vue.js application forms the backbone of the development framework, providing the essential tools and features needed to build and run Vue.js applications effectively.

== Our modules

This should give you an overall overview over the modules we have in the frontend of Foxdeck.

=== home

INFO: This module does not have a good purpose for now. This will be refined in future versions of Foxdeck.

=== login

This module contains logic for:

* login / Sign in
* register / Sign up

=== resource-navigation

This module contains the side-navigation which is used to navigate through folders and notes. The side-navigation is self-contained and fetches the resources from the backend itself.
