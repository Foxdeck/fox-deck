= Architecture and Technologies

This section should give you a basic understanding of the general architecture and technology decisions of Foxdeck.
For more detailed information you should look into the more specific sections.

== Overview

Foxdeck is a web application that utilizes modern web technologies to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience.
The application consists of a frontend developed in Vue.js and a backend based on NestJS.

== Frontend

The frontend of Foxdeck is where the application's user experience comes to life, crafted using *https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js]*, a progressive JavaScript framework known for its adaptability and component-based architecture.
This choice reflects a commitment to creating an intuitive and dynamic user interface, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the application's features.

To complement Vue.js, we've embraced *https://tailwindcss.com/[TailwindCSS]* for styling.
TailwindCSS's utility-first approach grants us the flexibility to design a bespoke user interface without the overhead of excessive custom CSS.
This results in a clean, modern, and responsive design that enhances the overall user experience, making navigation and interaction with Foxdeck both pleasant and efficient.

We have decided against UI libraries, but build our components ourselves based on https://github.com/material-components/material-web[Google's Material Design web components.]

== Backend

On the other side, the backend of Foxdeck is powered by *https://nestjs.com/[NestJS]*, a robust and versatile framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
NestJS provides a solid foundation for our application, ensuring stable performance and ease of maintenance.

For database migrations we use we've integrated *https://www.prisma.io/[Prisma]*.
However, we use Prisma **only** for the migration of databases, not for operations on the database.

We use *https://kysely.dev/[kysely]* for database operations.
"Kysely" is a type-safe SQL query builder for TypeScript and JavaScript. It's designed to provide developers with a way to write SQL queries in a structured and secure manner, reducing the risk of SQL injection attacks.

Furthermore, our RESTful API, a key component of our backend architecture, is meticulously documented using *https://swagger.io/[Swagger]*.
This documentation is not only a valuable resource, it's also the "single source of truth" for developers and serves as the backbone for our TypeScript API generation.

With *https://github.com/acacode/swagger-typescript-api[swagger-typescript-api]*, we automatically create a TypeScript interface for our API, ensuring a smooth and type-safe integration between our frontend and backend.
