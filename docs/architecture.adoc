== Architecture and Technologies

This section should give you an understanding of the general architecture of fox-deck.

=== Overview

Fox-Deck is a web application that utilizes modern web technologies to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience.
The application consists of a front-end developed in Vue.js and a back-end based on NestJS.

==== Front-End

The front-end of Fox-Deck is where the application's user experience comes to life, crafted using *https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js]*, a progressive JavaScript framework known for its adaptability and component-based architecture.
This choice reflects a commitment to creating an intuitive and dynamic user interface, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the application's features.

To complement Vue.js, we've embraced *https://tailwindcss.com/[TailwindCSS]* for styling.
TailwindCSS's utility-first approach grants us the flexibility to design a bespoke user interface without the overhead of excessive custom CSS.
This results in a clean, modern, and responsive design that enhances the overall user experience, making navigation and interaction with Fox-Deck both pleasant and efficient.

==== Back-End

On the other side, the back-end of Fox-Deck is powered by *https://nestjs.com/[NestJS]*, a robust and versatile framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
NestJS provides a solid foundation for our application, ensuring stable performance and ease of maintenance.

For database interactions, we've integrated *https://www.prisma.io/[Prisma]* as our ORM.
Prisma's focus on type safety, ease of use, and powerful querying capabilities make it an ideal choice for managing our application's data.
It streamlines database operations, making them more intuitive and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Furthermore, our RESTful API, a key component of our back-end architecture, is meticulously documented using *https://swagger.io/[Swagger]*.
This documentation is not only a valuable resource for developers but also serves as the backbone for our TypeScript API generation.
With *https://github.com/acacode/swagger-typescript-api["swagger-typescript-api"]*, we automatically create a TypeScript interface for our API, ensuring a smooth and type-safe integration between our front-end and back-end.
