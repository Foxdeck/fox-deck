Icons are small graphical elements used in user interfaces to represent actions, objects, or ideas visually.

<Canvas of={IconStories.Default} />

<Canvas of={IconStories.Loading} />

> HINT: There is also an Enumeration `Icon` (currently in `icon.ts`). We prefer to use this Enumeration for using icons
in the code.
