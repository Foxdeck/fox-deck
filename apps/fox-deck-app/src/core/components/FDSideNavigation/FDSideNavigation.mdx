# SideNavigation

## Usage

A button is an interactive element that allows the user to perform actions. There are two main types of buttons,
each used for different purposes:

### Primary

The primary button is used for the main action on a page or form. This is usually the action you most expect from the
user or the most important action available. For example, this could be "Submit", "Save", or "Continue". This button is
often designed to be more prominent to draw the userâ€™s attention.

## Secondary

The secondary button is used for less critical actions. It's visually less emphasized than the primary button and is
often used for actions like "Cancel" or "Back".

## Design

Buttons should be designed to be easily identifiable and usable. This includes clear labeling, adequate size, and a
contrasting design that stands out from the background. Buttons should have interactive states such as hover, focus,
and active that provide visual feedback when interacted with.

### Labeling

The button's label should be clear and concise. It must clearly describe the function that the button performs.

## Behavior

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

Buttons should be navigable using the keyboard, by tabbing to reach and enter/space to activate.
