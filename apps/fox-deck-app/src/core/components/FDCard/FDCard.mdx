# Card


## Usage

A card in UX/UI Design is a modular and flexible content container that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. It's a box that contains related elements such as a title, a description, an image or icon, and possibly an action.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

The FDCard-Component has two optional slots:

* **header**: contains the card header (title)
* **body**: contains the card body (text or images)
