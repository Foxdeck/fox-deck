# DropDown

## Usage

A DropDown is an interactive element that allows the user to select from an expandable list of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={DropDownStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Design

DropDowns should be designed to be easily identifiable and usable. This includes clear labeling, adequate size, and a
contrasting design that stands out from the background.

### Labeling

The label should be clear and concise. It must clearly describe the items the DropDown contains.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

The DropDown and its items should be navigable using the keyboard, by tabbing to reach and enter/space to activate.
