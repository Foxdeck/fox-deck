## Usage

A text input is an interactive element that allows the user to type text in it.

## Design

Text inputs should be designed to be easily identifiable and usable. This includes clear labeling, adequate size, and a
contrasting design that stands out from the background. It's important that the user knows, when the input is focused
or disabled.
