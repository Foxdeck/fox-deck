# TextInput

## Usage

A text input is an interactive element that allows the user to type text in it.

## Design

Text inputs should be designed to be easily identifiable and usable. This includes clear labeling, adequate size, and a
contrasting design that stands out from the background. It's important that the user knows, when the input is focused
or disabled.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={FDToolbar.Primary} />
</Canvas>

### Labeling

The label should be clear and concise. It must clearly describe, what the users input should be.

### Focused

On focus the input fields label will be pushed on top the input field.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
The input should be navigable using the keyboard, by tabbing to reach and enter/space to activate.
