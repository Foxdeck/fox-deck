  # Icons

  Icons are small graphical elements used in user interfaces to represent actions, objects, or ideas visually. They
  enhance the user experience by providing intuitive, easily recognizable symbols that convey meaning quickly and
  efficiently. Icons help users navigate, perform actions, and understand information without relying solely on text.

  ## Description

  We are using the icon library from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/uicons/interface-icons">flaticon</a> as the
  foundation for our project. These icons feature a rounded shape, making them ideal for aligning with the design
  philosophy of Material Design.
